# Elm Edn

A library for parsing, decoding, and encoding 
[extensible data notation, "edn"](https://github.com/edn-format/edn)

This is very useful for communicating between Clojure and Elm.

# Prior Art

The tests in this library and the escaped unicode parsing are largely drawn from
[Robert Vollmert's](https://github.com/robx) excellent 
[elm-edn](https://github.com/robx/elm-edn) library.
